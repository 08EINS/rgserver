$var title: Name guidelines
<div class="prose">
    <h2>Name guidelines</h2>
    <p>Please don't make references to rape.</p>
    <p>Please don't add ornament to your name to make it stand out. For example,
    "XxX~Kawaii~Robot~XxX" can be trimmed to "Kawaii Robot."</p>
    <p>Please don't write your name in all caps. Exception: when it's an
    acronym.</p>
    <p>Please don't name yourself "test," because test robots shouldn't be
    submitted.</p>
    <p>Profanity is ok, but please leave out racial or gender slurs.</p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
