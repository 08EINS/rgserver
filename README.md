[Robot Game](http://robotgame.net) server code
===================================

Please use github issues for server code/infrastructure related tasks/bugs/feature requests.

Workflow:

1.  Fork and checkout project
2.  Create a virtualenv and install requirements with "pip install -r requirements.txt".
3.  Copy all the X.example files and remove the ".example" suffix, edit them according to your local environment. (If someone wants to explain in more detail what's involved here, please do so!)
4.  Code to your satisfaction.
5.  Make a pull request and wait for a committer to review and merge your code. Ping on IRC if it's taking more than a couple days to get a response. :)

Thank you.

Yes, in the interest of getting this code out there, I'll leave README just as is. Feel free to elaborate and make this better and easier for a new dev.
