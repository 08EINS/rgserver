    <p>In Robot Game, you write programs to control robots that fight for you. The game is played on a 19x19 grid. The goal is to end up with more bots left than your opponent after 100 turns.</p>
    <p><img src="static/rules1.png"/></p>
    <p>Dark squares represent where you can't walk. As you can see, this effectively creates a circle arena where your robots fight.</p>
    <p>The green squares represent spawn points. Every <b>$settings.spawn_every</b> turns, a batch of <b>$settings.spawn_per_player</b> robots will spawn at random spawn points for each player, and any robot still standing on a spawn point will die.</p>
    <p>Each robot starts out with <b>$settings.robot_hp</b> HP.</p>
    <p>Robots can generally act (move, attack, etc.) on the squares one above, left, right, and below it&mdash;its <i>adjacent squares</i>.</p>
    <p><img src="http://puu.sh/53gY0.png"/></p>
    <p>Each turn, every robot can take one action:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Move</b> into an adjacent square. If there's already a robot
            there, or if another robot tries to move into the same square, both
            robots will lose <b>$settings.collision_damage</b> HP as collision
            damage, and the move(s) won't happen. On the other hand, if a robot
            tries to move into a square with a robot already there, but that
            robot successfully moves out the same turn, both robots will move.
            <br/><br/>
            Four robots in a square, all moving clockwise, will move, as will
            any number of robots that move in a circle (4 is the minimum,
            robots cannot directly swap places).
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <b>Attack</b> an adjacent square. If there is a robot in that
            square <i>at the end of the turn</i>&mdash;i.e. a robot stayed
            there or successfully moved into that square&mdash;that robot will
            lose between <b>$settings.attack_range[0]</b> and
            <b>$settings.attack_range[1]</b> HP as attack damage.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <b>Suicide</b>. The robot will die at the end of the turn, dealing
            <b>$settings.suicide_damage</b> to any robots next to it
            <i>at the end of the turn</i>.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <b>Guard</b>. The robot will stay put, take half damage from
            attacks and suicides, and take no damage from collisions.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There is no friendly damage in this game. Collisions, attacks, and
        suicides will <i>only damage the opponent</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whoever has more robots left after <b>$settings.max_turns</b> turns
        wins.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your get to code the AI for a single robot. All your robots will use
        this AI. To win, your robots must work together with other copies of
        themselves&mdash;to surround an enemy robot, for example.
