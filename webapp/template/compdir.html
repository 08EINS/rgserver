        Submit your code using the form on the robot's page. Note that this is just a form for you to submit code.
        You should <em>write</em> your code somewhere else, and just paste it in after making sure it works with
        <a href="https://github.com/RobotGame/rgkit">rgkit</a>.</p>
    <p>
        After your code has been successfully saved, the server will run it against other robots throughout the day,
        and your rating and match history will update automatically. You'll also be able to challenge other robots
        in the warehouse.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Keep in mind that saving does not compile your code nor test it against the limits specified in the <a href="/security">Security</a> page.
        Make sure to watch your bot's matches and match logs for server errors.
    </p>
